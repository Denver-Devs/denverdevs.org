The first hour of our CoP meetup consists of a Deep-dive discussion. One or more CoP core members facilitate this discussion on a specific topic, related to applying and using lean, flow, pull, or kanban concepts, and selected by them from a list of candidate topics (options) that the CoP maintains. Please note the Deep-dive discussions are not limited to being introductions to lean, flow, pull, or kanban concepts. However, they are open to all who want to attend regardless of their experience level.</p> <p>After a short break, the second hour of our CoP meetup typically consists of a \"Lean Coffee\" format, where everyone attending puts forth questions, issues, topics, etc. to be considered related to applying and using lean, flow, pull, or kanban concepts, and these can be at any experience level. If you're not familiar with Lean Coffee, a quick Google search can provide a number of brief overviews.

LET'S MAKE SOME STUFF!</p> <p>Are you a coder looking to get your name out there?</p> <p>Or are you a dev team leads who is looking for potential hires?</p> <p>Maybe you're a designer who just loves making cool stuff with new people?</p> <p>You're in luck! Mile High Hacks wants all of you to come to spend 24 hours building some sick new tech.</p> <p>Come pitch your idea (or just join a team)<br/>Spend a whole day making a completely fleshed out idea (or a proof of concept)<br/>Show it off in front of an excited crowd (or watch someone else on your team demo)<br/>PARTY (or PAAARTAAYYY!)</p> <p>Hang out with AWS, World Wide Technologies, Denver Indie Hackers, Denver React Meetup, Hotel Engine, and Code for Denver. Have free food and drinks. Plus your team might even win a cash prize!</p> <p>Currently, the prize total is at $1500!</p> <p>Theme?</p> <p>This event is all about Denver and the awesome people who live here: Kind of a “Neighborhood Hack”. Let’s connect people together using technology. Maybe people make a rideshare app to help people find a way up to the slopes; Maybe a food truck finder; Maybe a way to rent out your parking spot. We’re looking for ideas that bring Denverites together and help each other out!</p> <p>Who's this for?</p> <p>Our goal is to make this as fun as possible for developers/designers, and one of the consistent pieces of feedback we got from people was that at other events sometimes there are just a bunch of recent bootcamp grads and recruiters. Our goal is to make sure that doesn’t happen. We’re shooting for this as the average team at the hackathon</p> <p>1-2 Junior Devs</p> <p>1-3 Mid/Senior Devs</p> <p>1 Designer</p> <p>To that end, we stacked the deck with fun/experienced devs before we opened this up to the public. We are also making sure that we check in with experience levels as people sign up so that the ratios don’t lean too junior. We hope this makes it so people can make some really fun projects!</p> <p>What’s the Schedule?</p> <p>One of the other big pieces of feedback we got was that an all-weekend hackathon was simply not feasible for people. Work your butt off all weekend, and then got back to work on Monday. No fun. So… we’re not going to do that! We’re doing a 24-hour blitz hack.</p> <p>Friday, Oct 25th - Pitch night partaaaay! (Participants only)</p> <p>6 pm - Hangout time before official events.</p> <p>7 pm - People pitch ideas. Everyone cheers and drink beers!</p> <p>8 pm - People break into teams, and designate a team leader</p> <p>After pm -&gt; HANG OUT! (Maybe some crazy people start coding right away?!?!?!)</p> <p>Saturday Oct 26th - Build, Show, and Victory!</p> <p>7 am - Doors open if people want to come in early, stake out a spot and have some coffee, and bagels and stuff.</p> <p>8 am - Team leaders from every team are at the space by this time to make sure they know what’s up. Connect with volunteer staff</p> <p>9 am - Ideally all participants are present and making stuff from this point onward we’ll do ourly shout-out stand-ups where every team says 1 sentence about what they’ve done.</p> <p>Noon - Lunch is provided! Beer begins!</p> <p>6 pm - Dinner is provided! Beer Continues!</p> <p>6:30 pm - We connect with every team to make sure their demo can hook into the display system and go over what order they’ll be in.</p> <p>8 pm - (Open to the public) Everyone has a quick demo of their thing (It definitely won’t be a broken, hack-y mess… definitely!). Then our judges will pick a winner, and they get a prize. HOORAY!</p> <p>After pm - HANG OUT!

This talk will discuss what problems Cortex solves, Cortex's architecture, and how to get started. Cortex is a CNCF Sandbox project.</p> <p>BIO: Chris is a Software Engineer at Splunk where he delivers observability for teams working on multiple internal Kubernetes clusters.

Kubernetes can help you lifecycle and scale those services— But what about monitoring? Rollouts? Security policies? Adding a service mesh can help you tackle this set of challenges. In this talk, we'll learn how Istio, an open-source service mesh tool, lets you automate, monitor, and secure traffic for your services, without any changes to your application code. Through demos, we'll explore how Istio works, then incrementally add Istio configuration to our cluster for telemetry, traffic encryption, and network policies. You'll leave this talk understanding what a service mesh is for, and which subset of Istio features might work for you.</p> <p>BIO: Megan O'Keefe is a Developer Relations Engineer at Google Cloud, where she helps users adopt microservices and service mesh technologies. Previously a Software Engineer at Cisco, Megan spent two years working on multi-cluster Kubernetes for edge computing. Today, Megan helps build tools and demos like istiobyexample.dev, and has spoken about Kubernetes at the Grace Hopper Celebration, KubeCon, and Google Cloud NEXT. She is interested in DevOps, Go, and open source.</p> <p>[08:00 - 08:30 PM] Stick around, socialize &amp; network!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1533832826000,"duration":10800000,"id":"jnhjcqyznbwb","name":"Monthly Meeting","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1571355000000,"local_date":"2019-10-17","local_time":"17:30","updated":1533832826000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":6,"venue":{"id":1532503,"name":"Microsoft","lat":39.63044738769531,"lon":-104.90279388427734,"repinned":false,"address_1":"7595 Technology Way #400","city":"Denver","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"(720) 528-1700","zip":"80237","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1358193360000,"name":"Denver SQL Server User Group","id":6658252,"join_mode":"open","lat":39.63999938964844,"lon":-104.9000015258789,"urlname":"Denver-SQL-Server-User-Group","who":"SQL Family","localized_location":"Denver, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Denver-SQL-Server-User-Group/events/jnhjcqyznbwb/","description":"<p>Meeting Agenda:</p> <p>5:30 - 6:00 - Food / Socializing</p> <p>6:00 - 6:15 - User Group Business</p> <p>6:15 - 6:30 - Open Panel/Questions &amp; Answers</p> <p>6:30 - 7:00 - Warmup presentation</p> <p>7:00 - 8:00 - Main presentation</p> <p>Make sure you get to the Microsoft office before 6pm as the lobby doors automatically lock at 6pm and the elevators only work with a building badge after 6pm.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1554139464000,"duration":5400000,"id":"lsdnvqyzpbhb","name":"SQLunch at Two Great Locations","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1572978600000,"local_date":"2019-11-05","local_time":"11:30","updated":1554139464000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":26058803,"name":"Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery","lat":39.74745178222656,"lon":-104.99478912353516,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1001 16th St Mall #A-100","city":"Denver","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"80265","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1358193360000,"name":"Denver SQL Server User Group","id":6658252,"join_mode":"open","lat":39.63999938964844,"lon":-104.9000015258789,"urlname":"Denver-SQL-Server-User-Group","who":"SQL Family","localized_location":"Denver, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Denver-SQL-Server-User-Group/events/lsdnvqyzpbhb/","description":"<p>SQLunch is intended to be a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere for questions, networking, and everything social that we can’t cover in presentations!

She works with design (UX and UI) and developers, business owners and other members of software development teams. Her role is to ensure that new website updates and features are created in ways that ensure they are accessible for everyone.</p> <p>For our meeting she will explain who we are designing for and how we can get there without compromising our creativity. We'll talk about color contrast, alt text for logos and images, how to imagine your designs being accessed by keyboard-only methods as well as how you can test your assumptions and your designs while they are still wireframes.</p> <p>Bring your questions. Send us a url in advance and we'll do a little accessibility/ design group investigation at the meeting.</p> <p>We will have pizza at 5:45 pm (Ron will pick up early so it's there on time)!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1546285168000,"duration":7200000,"id":"kcnlcryzpbxb","name":"State of the Word: What's happening in WordPress for 2020?","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1574125200000,"local_date":"2019-11-18","local_time":"18:00","updated":1570415295000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":1277578,"name":"Boulder Digital Arts","lat":40.01512145996094,"lon":-105.22959899902344,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1600 Range Street","address_2":"Suite 100","city":"Boulder","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"303-800-4647","zip":"80301","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1251608886000,"name":"Boulder WordPress Meetup","id":1515077,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.040000915527344,"lon":-105.30999755859375,"urlname":"BoulderWP","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boulder, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/BoulderWP/events/kcnlcryzpbxb/","description":"<p>Several of our WordPress Meetup members who attended WordCamp US in St. Louis the first of November will return to talk about what we learned, the sessions that inspired us, and review the \"State of the Word\" the talk that Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress gives every year about the future of the WordPress open source project.</p> <p>Angela will break down the various legal entities beyond WordPress and its creation and the emerging movement in the WordPress community for governance of WordPress.</p> <p><a href=\"https://wpgovernance.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://wpgovernance.com/</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1546285168000,"duration":7200000,"id":"kcnlcryzqbvb","name":"Boulder WP Meetup Holiday Party!!!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1576544400000,"local_date":"2019-12-16","local_time":"18:00","updated":1570415514000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":1277578,"name":"Boulder Digital Arts","lat":40.01512145996094,"lon":-105.22959899902344,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1600 Range Street","address_2":"Suite 100","city":"Boulder","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"303-800-4647","zip":"80301","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1251608886000,"name":"Boulder WordPress Meetup","id":1515077,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.040000915527344,"lon":-105.30999755859375,"urlname":"BoulderWP","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boulder, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/BoulderWP/events/kcnlcryzqbvb/","description":"<p>Let's celebrate!

We’ll go over the engineering practices that allow us to deploy 20+ times/day and high confidence in our product.</p> <p>Bio: Brett has worked in a variety of languages: C++, C#, Python, Go, and Ruby and a variety of roles including automation and tooling, backend engineering, team lead, and management roles. He believes in enabling teams through individual empowerment and autonomy; this manifests through both culture and process but velocity with confidence is his guiding light.</p> <p>==================================</p> <p>Talk 2: Rails API performance and sparse fields by Logan Sears - Technical Product Manager &amp; Sr. Software Engineer @ Brandfolder</p> <p>Description: With the growth of our business, and the content people store in their Brandfolder we’ve seen an increasing need to make sure our API/platform are performant. We’ll go over a few specific efforts that have allowed us to scale our Rails API including leveraging sparse fields, and a deep dive into performance on our highest throughput endpoint.</p> <p>Bio: Logan has spent much of his career becoming adept within the Ruby on Rails ecosystem and it’s surrounding tooling and methodologies. He enjoys creating thoughtful code that tries to achieve both maintainability and elegance. Most recently, he has directed his focus to impact the future of the product decisions at Brandfolder; he has significant perspective that allows him to collaborate with the team and come to product decisions while keeping in mind the technical implications.</p> <p>==================================</p> <p>If you would like to present at this meeting, or at upcoming events, reach out to the organizers on this meetup or ping us at @boulderruby (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/boulderruby\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/boulderruby</a>) on Twitter.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Suite 115 - Recurly Offices","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1567888270000,"duration":10800000,"id":"fzqshryzpbrb","name":"Monthly Presentation Night","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1573691400000,"local_date":"2019-11-13","local_time":"17:30","updated":1567888270000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":9633882,"name":"1050 Walnut St","lat":40.01633071899414,"lon":-105.28107452392578,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1050 Walnut St","city":"Boulder","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"80302","state":"Co"},"group":{"created":1382361357000,"name":"Boulder Ruby Group","id":10777872,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.040000915527344,"lon":-105.27999877929688,"urlname":"boulder_ruby_group","who":"Rubyists","localized_location":"Boulder, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boulder_ruby_group/events/fzqshryzpbrb/","description":"<p>Join us at our monthly gathering where we present topics of interest to Rubyists and aspiring programmers.</p> <p>Doors open at 5:30pm, where you can hangout and socialize with other Boulder Ruby members.

We hear from a lot of people we talk to that they're not sure whether they're interested in a job in the tech field, because they don't know enough about it. Sometimes, they've even been told that \"programming is hard to learn.\"</p> <p>At The Tech Academy, we work hard to break down the barriers between people and technology. We think that, with the right approach, anyone can learn to code - and whether you end up working in technology or not, the principles behind coding are useful in a lot of areas.</p> <p>The Tech Academy is offering a free course on Introduction to JavaScript.
