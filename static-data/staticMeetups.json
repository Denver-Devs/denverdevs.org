It aims to enable the secure movement of blockchain processing off the main chain to dedicated computing resources. Avalon is designed to help developers gain the benefits of computational trust and mitigate its drawbacks.</p> <p>Eugene is a systems architect at Intel who has over 20 years of experience designing and building distributed and decentralized solutions spanning from embedded firmware to large scale cloud solutions. During last several years Eugene focuses on scalability and confidentiality for public and private blockchains, specifically on utilizing trusted execution environments for off-chain workload execution.
