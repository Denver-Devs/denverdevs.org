# Contributing to the Denver Devs Website

We love contributions of all shapes that go toward enriching our community (and the websites that power us) — you're welcome to chip in wherever and whenever you have the time in the form of:

- Reporting a bug or issue
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Discussing new features
- Implementing new features
- Helping with chores (updating packages, typos, etc.)
- And whatever else you can think of! 

### How do I contribute code? 

First up we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) — so go check that out if you're not familiar. The gist is: fork this repo, make a branch, do your changes, push that branch up, and submit a PR to the original repo! If you get stuck check out this guide: [Contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) and follow along with it. We'll then review the PR and work from there to either nudge it in the right direction or get it approved and merged. 

Outside of using Github Flow all we ask is that you either find an existing ticket or create a ticket for whatever you're working on *before* commiting to any code work (this includes bugs, features, etc. If you want to propose a new feature please pop open a discussion so we can get aligned before you start writing code). Also engaging in a considerate and caring way is a must — no elitism, gatekeeping, or insults at all. 

We have a linter in place that'll also format and check your code, so be sure to run `yarn lint` before pushing code up to avoid some headaches. 


### Do's and Dont's

- DO keep it fun and friendly, no nasty discussions or bad vibes
- DO come with any and all ideas. We love to hear it! Discuss away
- DO bring any kind of skill level in! Even if you're brand new, we can be an opportunity to learn from!
- DO write issues with as much detail as possible. 
- DON'T alter anything that has to do with formatting or consistency in the code without discussing it first 

### Thank you for checking us out, and taking the time to hop into the site!
