## Only posts that are "Looking For Work" & "Hiring" are allowed

## You must be the "source" of the post. No "my friend is looking for x" or "I saw this link on Y to sharing here". No sharing of jobs purely for a referral

## You must use real name & a real photo of yourself or your company logo (not required for individuals seeking work)

## No Unsolicited DMs

## Provide as much info as publicly possible in your post. If hiring you must have: tech stack, location & minimum salary estimate (or compensation)

## Keep replies as questions or sharing of the job board rules, and threaded or in a DM
    Replies should only be seeking clarification over a posts details or politely sharing these guidelines with the OP as a joint effort on improving the post quality. Debates about the perceived quality of a post or hiring practices should be taken to #industry-opinions. Please remain civil in these debates and allow the original poster the option to engage in them. 

## Do not repeat your post more than once every seven days, and do not bump your post
   For example: If you posted on Tuesday you couldn't post that same job posting until the following Tuesday. We also have a "Gigs Day" every Wednesday and encourage you to shoot for posting on that day. "Bumping" your post is when you post something and then a while later delete that post and re-post it. Don't do that.

## When looking for work
- Use "tags" to add clarity to the post, such as: [Looking For Work] [Front End Developer] [Junior] or use the `/gigs_bot` command.
- Be concise with your language but rich in details. Two to three sentences with enough information will do it.
- If you need to add more details use threads to add more information.
- Do not upload your resume to Slack, host it somewhere and link to it in your post.

#### Example: 
```
[Looking for Work][Front End Developer][Mid-Senior]

I'm looking for work at a small 5-10 person product
company where I can bring my expertise in React and front end 
development. 

View my portfolio | View my Resume
```
