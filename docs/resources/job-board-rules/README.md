# Job board rules & guidelines

## Only posts that are “Looking For Work” & “Hiring” are allowed

All other posts should go in an appropriate channel. Looking for someone working somewhere? Ask in #dd-community or #help. Want to chat about best hiring practices? Hop over to #career-advice or #industry-opinions.

## You must be the “source” of the post.

No “my friend is looking for x” or “I saw this link on Y to sharing here”. No sharing of jobs purely for a referral

## You must use real name & a real photo of yourself or your company logo (not required for individuals seeking work)

We want folks to be honest and identifiable. If you’re a company that’s hiring someone you should be open and clear about where you work and who you are.

## No Unsolicited DMs

No one likes spam. Please do not reach out to anyone unless they’ve given you permission. If you’re having trouble with someone spamming you please reach out to an admin and we’ll take care of it.

## Provide as much info as possible. If hiring you must have: tech stack, location & compensation.

Specificity is your friend here. Add as many details as you can while respecting your client confidentiality and the public nature of Denver Devs.

*Note:* [A new law was passed in Colorado](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-085) that took effect on January 1, 2021, related to pay transparency. It requires that:
* Employers must announce to all Colorado employees current job openings, and the pay ranges associated with them.  
* All job postings for positions that can be hired for and/or performed in Colorado must indicate the hourly or salary compensation, or a range of the hourly or salary compensation, and a general description of all the benefits and other compensation to be offered to the hired applicant.

## Keep replies as questions or sharing of the job board rules, and threaded or in a DM

Replies should only be seeking clarification over a posts details or politely sharing these guidelines with the OP as a joint effort on improving the post quality. Debates about the perceived quality of a post or hiring practices should be taken to #industry-opinions. Please remain civil in these debates and allow the original poster the option to engage in them.

## Do not repeat your post more than once every seven days, and do not bump your post

For example: If you posted on Tuesday you couldn’t post that same job posting until the following Tuesday. We also have a “Gigs Day” every Wednesday and encourage you to shoot for posting on that day. “Bumping” your post is when you post something and then a while later delete that post and re-post it. Don’t do that.

#### Formatting when looking for work

- Use "tags" to add clarity to the post, such as: `[Looking For Work][front end developer] [Junior]` or use the `/gigs_bot` command.
- Be concise with your language but rich in details. Four to five sentences with enough information will do it in the main body of the post, tuck the rest into a thread if you need to.
- Do not upload your resume to Slack, host it somewhere and link to it in your post.

#### Example:

```
[Looking for Work][Front End Developer][Mid-Senior]

I'm looking for work at a small 5-10 person product
company where I can bring my expertise in React and front end
development.

View my portfolio | View my Resume
```

#### Formatting when hiring

- Use "tags" to add clarity to the post, such as: `[Hiring][front end developer] [React, Redux][90 - 105k]` or use the `/gigs_bot` command.
- Be concise with your language but rich in details. Two to three sentences with enough information will do it. You **must** have: tech stack, location & minimum salary estimate.
- Unfurls from links will be removed. Keep that in mind when you post.
